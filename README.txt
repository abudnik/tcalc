C++ COMPILE-TIME PROLOG INTERPRETER
-----------------------------------

C++ Templates are Turing Complete. It means that any computation expressible by a
computer program can be computed, in some form, by a template metaprogram.

prolog.cpp - Prolog-like program examples
tcalc.h    - Prolog interpreter source
test.cpp   - various tests

P.S. Every good programmer should write at least one weird program, like chess game
written in 'sed' utility, artificial neural network in Brainfuck, etc.
